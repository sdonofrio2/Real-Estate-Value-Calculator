**Project Description:**

    With home prices rising during this COVID period, many are concerned about housing affordability, especially the gap between property values and the income of people currently living or moving to  Philadelphia. If we can compare property values of homes in different neighborhoods of Philadelphia and the socio-economic background of people who reside or are moving to these areas, we can identify neighborhoods where the affordability gap is particularly severe. 

    To do this, we propose building a calculator with data visualization application to predict housing pricing and socio-economic data geographically mapped to Philadelphia neighborhoods. Our calculator will show the distribution of property values across the city and allow users to filter on a specific neighborhood in order to compare property values with various socio-economic statistics for that neighborhood

    This calculator will determine if a house is a good investment.
