# Python Library Ideas
----------------------------------------------------------------
## Bokeh
* Tool for creating interactive and scalable visualizations inside browsers
## Scrapy
* Helps to build crawling programs (spider bots) that can retrieve structured data from the web â€“ for example, URLs or contact info. 
* Used for scraping data.
## TensorFlow
* A framework for defining and running computations that involve tensors, which are partially defined computational objects that eventually produce a value.
## PyTorch
*  Python-based scientific computing package that uses the power of graphics processing units. PyTorch is one of the most commonly preferred deep learning research platforms built to provide maximum flexibility and speed.
