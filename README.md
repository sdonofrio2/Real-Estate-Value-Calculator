**Project Description:**

    With the Real Estate Market being competitive we wanted to find properties for sale that were a good value. To do this, we built a calculator with data visualization application to predict housing pricing geographically mapped to Philadelphia neighborhoods. Our calculator will show the distribution of property values across the city and allow users to filter on a specific property for sale in order to compare property values for recently sold properties in that neighborhood.

    This calculator will determine if a house is a good investment.

**Questions and Data:**

    Is a home for sale comparable to:
        - others of similar size
        - number of bedrooms/bathrooms
        - location, etc
    -   To answer our questions, we needed housing data for houses for sale and recently sold homes. We also needed the data to contain the square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms for each home. We utilized the Zillow-API for all of the above data.     

***
**Data Cleanup & Exploration**

    We used an API call of Zillow data for houses for sale and recently sold in the Philadelphia area. We converted the API data into pickle files to store the results since number of calls were limited per user and a cost issue was presented by using this API. 


    

**Data to be used:**

    Zillow API
